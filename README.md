# ticTacToe
My game that requires two players.
Each player has a symbol.
The first person to player will be given symbol 'X' while the next player will be given symbol 'O'.
Players will play until a player has his/her three symbols aligned on the same row/ column/ or diagonal position.
The row/ column/ diagonal will turn green and an alert will be sent to display the player with either symbol has won.
In case of a tie the game should let the players know its a tie and ask them to restart the game.
Enjoy my game!!!
